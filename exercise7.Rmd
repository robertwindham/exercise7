# Orchid species richness





**This dataset is looking at the species richness of orchid flora and their response to 30 different environmental factors in 3500 grid cells in the Beipan River Basin in Guizhou Province. For this exercise I selected species richness as the response variable and mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, elevation, human population density, and area of cropland as predictor variables.**

```{r Study area map, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(106.142542, 24.946307, zoom = 2.8) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(106.142542, 24.946307, popup = "Beipan River Basin")

```










# Colinearity



```{r check for colinearity, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggpairs(orch, columns = 3:7) + theme_bw()
```



**We have a high correlation between Mean Annual Temperature and Mean Annual Precipitation, as expected. There is relatively low correlation between the other variables.**



```{r fitmodel to look at Variance Inflation Factor, echo=TRUE}
model_1 <- lm(richness ~ MAT + MAP + elevation + population + cropland, data=orch)
anova (model_1) #coefficients of the full model
```



```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
olsrr::ols_plot_added_variable(model_1)
```





## Multicolinearity Check



```{r check model for multicolinearity, echo=FALSE}
performance::check_collinearity(model_1)
#VIF are also translated to Tolerance values, where tolerance = 1/vif
```

**Since all variables have a Variance Inflation Factor less than 5, we can conclude that there is a low correlation between the predictor variables.**




# Model Performance



```{r check model, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}
performance::check_model(model_1)
```


# Possible Models



```{r fit dredge model, echo=FALSE}
# change na. action
options(na.action = "na.fail") # otherwise blows up with NA values
dredge_1<-dredge(model_1)

dredge_1
```


**There are 32 possible models based on additive combinations of variables (no interaction terms).**



## Best Models



```{r best subset, echo=FALSE}
# grab best supported models
subset(dredge_1, delta < 6)
```


```{r equally-competitve models, echo=FALSE}
#grab equally competitive models
subset(dredge_1, delta <2)
```


## Variable Importance Weights



```{r echo=FALSE}
# calculate variable importance weights
sw(dredge_1) #notice this is the global model, not just the competitive model set
```

**We can see that area of cropland, elevation, mean annual precipitation, and human population density are all equally important. Mean annual temperature is less important, but it should still be considered.**




# Model Averaging



```{r Model Averaging, echo=FALSE}
# Model average using all candidate models, always use revised.var = TRUE
model.avg(dredge_1, revised.var = TRUE)
```





```{r look at the averaged coefficients, echo=TRUE}
#summary(model.avg(dredge_wash)) # if you want to average across all models, both competitive and non-competitive
summary(model.avg(dredge_1, subset = delta < 6)) # if you just want to look only at competitive models, which
#is the point of model selection.
#there is justification for looking only at the competitive models; trying to narrow things down.
```



# Plots



```{r I guess we should make a figure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=4}
w1 <- ggplot(orch, aes(cropland, richness)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x = "Cropland Area (m²)")
  #scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 700))

w2 <- ggplot(orch, aes(elevation, richness)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (m)")

w3 <- ggplot(orch, aes(population, richness)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x = "Pop. density per km²")

w4 <- ggplot(orch, aes(MAT, richness)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x = "Mean Annual Temp. (C)")

w5 <- ggplot(orch, aes(MAP, richness)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x = "Mean Annual Precip. (mm)")

w1 / w2 / w3 / w4 / w5 #patchwork notation for figure alignment

```




**Unsure why there are negative values for species richness. When including human population density as a predictive effect, we would want to use a different error structure because the prediction line becomes negative for population densities above 50,000 people per square kilometer**
